\section*{2.4}

\noindent
The multinormal distribution that we are sampling from is comprised of $p$
independent standard normal distributions. From normal distribution theory, the 
sum (and linear combination) of these $p$ normal distributions will also be 
normal. We note then that $z_{i}$ is just a linear combination of these normal 
random variables, so $z_{i}$ itself must be normal with mean $E(z_{i})$ and 
variance $V(z_{i})$.

\begin{gather*}
E(z_{i}) = 
E(a^{T} x_{i}) = 
a^{T} E(x_{i}) = 
a^{T} \overrightarrow{0} = 
0 \\ 
V(z_{i}) = 
V(a^{T} x_{i}) = 
\sum_{k = 1}^{p} V(a_{i} x_{i, k}) = 
\sum_{k = 1}^{p} a_{i}^{2} V(x_{i, k}) = 
\sum_{k = 1}^{p} a_{i}^{2} \times 1 = 
1 \\
\text{ because } a \text{ is unit length}
\end{gather*}

\noindent
So $z_{i}$ is normal with mean $0$ and variance $1$. It is given that the target 
point's distance from the origin is a chi-squared distribution with mean $p$, 
which implies the distance is $p^{0.5}$.
